# Section 1 Notes

## Agenda

 1. Linux
 2. Git
 3. Compilation

## 1. Linux

* Options for using ecelinux machines

    - directly use workstations in 314 Phillips Linux Lab
    - log in remotely from 318 Phillips Windows Lab
    - log in remotely from your own laptop ([Chrome Secure Shell](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo), [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/), [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/))
        - We recommend MobaXTerm as it is the easiest to use.
        - If you're using PuTTY, we recommend that you also install
          [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/).
    - MacOS users can directly use the "Terminal" application
        - Install [XQuartz](http://www.xquartz.org).
        - Log out, then log back in, as suggested in the XQuartz
          installation.
        - Open a terminal window.

* Logging into ecelinux

    ```bash
    # Don't use this... ssh -X <netid>@ecelinux-01.ece.cornell.edu
    # Don't use this... ssh -X <netid>@ecelinux-02.ece.cornell.edu
    ssh -X <netid>@ecelinux.ece.cornell.edu
    ```

* Verify that X-forwarding works

    ```bash
    xclock
    ```

    This should open a window showing an analogue clock.

* Setup Script

    ```bash
    source setup-ece2400.sh
    ```

* Working at the command line

    ```bash
    echo "Hello, World"
    man echo
    
    echo "Computer Systems Programming" > ece2400-sec1-01.txt
    cat ece2400-sec1-01.txt
    less ece2400-sec1-01.txt
    echo "ECE 2400" > ece2400-sec1-02.txt
    cat ece2400-sec1-01.txt ece2400-sec1-02.txt
    cp ece2400-sec1-01.txt ece2400-sec1-03.txt
    mv ece2400-sec1-02.txt ece2400-sec1-04.txt
    ls
    rm ece2400-sec1-*.txt
    
    pwd
    mkdir ece2400
    cd ece2400
    
    wget http://www.csl.cornell.edu/courses/ece2400/overview.txt
    grep --color "programming" overview.txt
    less overview.txt
    ```

* Editors

    - Geany, a GUI-based text-editor, simple, recommended

        ```bash
        geany
        ```

    - Micro, a text-based text-editor, simple, recommended

        ```bash
        micro
        ```

    - VIM: Vi IMproved, a text-based text-editor. For advanced users

        ```bash
        vim
        ```

* Quota

    ```bash
    quota
    echo "Hello World" > hello.txt
    quota
    ```

* Trash

    ```bash
    cd ${HOME}/tmp/misc
    echo "testing" > testing.txt
    trash testing.txt
    ls ~/tmp/trash/
    ```

* Which

    ```bash
    which bash
    which geany
    which trash
    ```

## 2. Git

Just wait through a few minutes of 'It's really pretty simple, just think of branches as...' and eventually you'll learn the commands that will fix everything." alt="Git" srcset="//imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git_2x.png 2x"></a>

* Create repo on GitHub

    - need an account on GitHub
    - Create repository named `ece2400-sec1-linux-git`
    - include default README.md

* The setup script creates SSH keys automatically for you

    - Check for keys

        ```bash
        ls ~/.ssh
        ```

    - `setup-ece2400.sh` automatically created keys
      `ece2400-github[.pub]`. Also configured your SSH config to use
      this key-pair for `github.com`.

        ```bash
        micro ~/.ssh/config
        ```

        These lines in `~/.ssh/config` tell the SSH client on ecelinux
        to use `ece2400-github` keys for `github.com`

        ```bash
        # added by setup-ece2400.sh
        Host github.com
          IdentityFile ~/.ssh/ece2400-github
        ```

        Copy and paste the contents of `ece2400-github.pub` into your
        [GitHub account](https://github.com/settings/keys).

        ```bash
        cat ~/.ssh/ece2400-github.pub
        # OR
        geany ~/.ssh/ece2400-github.pub
        ```

    - Upload your SSH keys to [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/ssh)

        ```bash
        cat ~/.ssh/ece2400-github.pub
        ```

* Create SSH keys on ecelinux and add them to GitHub

    - Check for existing keys

        ```bash
        ls ~/.ssh/
        ```

    - If you have setup existing keys for GitHub, or would like to use
      your own keys, create `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` if they don't
      exist ([GitHub help
      page](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/#platform-linux))

        ```bash
        ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
        ```

        [Add the SSH key to your GitHub
        account](https://github.com/settings/keys)

        ```bash
        cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
        # OR
        geany ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
        ```

        Undo changes made by the `setup-ece2400.sh` script

        ```bash
        micro ~/.ssh/config
        ```

        Delete these lines

        ```bash
        # added by setup-ece2400.sh
        Host github.com
          IdentityFile ~/.ssh/ece2400-github
        ```

        If you edit this file, please ensure that you run this command

        ```bash
        chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
        ```

* Verify that the SSH key works

    ```bash
    ssh -T git@github.com
    ```


* Clone repo

    ```bash
    mkdir -p $HOME/ece2400
    git clone git@github.com:<github_id>/ece2400-sec1-linux-git sec1
    cd sec1
    ```

* Tell Git who you are

    ```bash
    git config --global user.name
    git config --global user.name "<your name here>"
    git config --global user.email
    git config --global user.email "<your email here>"
    ```

* Modify the readme

    ```bash
    echo ""      >> README.md
    echo "red"   >> README.md
    echo "green" >> README.md
    echo "blue"  >> README.md
    ```

* Commit local changes and push to GitHub

    ```bash
    git status
    git stage README.md
    git commit -m "added some colors"
    git status
    git push
    ```

    - view on GitHub
    - view raw file
    - view commit log

* Multi-line commit messages

    - Set up Git text editor

        ```bash
        git config --global core.editor
        git config --global core.editor `which micro`
        ```
    - Add some colors to README.md
    - Commit

        ```bash
        git stage README.md
        git commit
        git push
        ```

    - Write [great commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules).

* Viewing the git commit history

    - From the command line
        - Everything, in a linear manner
            ```bash
            git log
            ```
        - Everything, with a graph
            ```bash
            git log --graph
            ```
        - One line per commit, compressed
            ```bash
            git log --oneline
            ```
        - One line per commit, compressed, with a graph
            ```bash
            git log --oneline --graph
            ```
        - GUI
            ```bash
            gitk
            ```

* Collaborate with your partner

    - add a collaborator
    - have collaborator add a few more colors, commit, and push
    - pull changes

        ```bash
        git pull
        git log
        less README.md
        ```

* Dealing with conflicts

    - Both students add two different colors, commit, and push
    - Second push will fail, need to pull, resolve merge conflicts, and
      push

        ```bash
        git pull
        git status
        geany README.md     ## Or use vim
        git stage README.md ## Mark conflict as resolved
        git commit -m "Conflict resolved"
        git status
        git log --graph
        git push
        ```

* Use TravisCI

    - lets assume we want to verify our README.md has the color red

        ```bash
        grep "red" README.md
        ```

    - we want to automatically check for red on _every_ commit
    - turn on TravisCI
    - <https://travis-ci.org/profile/&lt;github_id&gt;>
    - flip the switch
    - add a `.travis.yml` file which does our check

        ```bash
        geany .travis.yml
        ```

        add contents

        ```yaml
        script:
          - grep red README.md
        ```

        commit and push

        ```bash
        git add .travis.yml
        git commit -m "add support for travis"
        git push
        ```

    - <https://travis-ci.org/&lt;github_id&gt;/ece2400-sec1-linux-git>
    - let's add a badge to our README using GitHub online text edit and
      pull

        ```bash
        git pull
        ```

    - now let's break our "code"
    - remove "red" from the README.md
    - add/commit/push

        ```bash
        git status
        git stage README.md
        git status
        git commit -m "removed red"
        git push
        ```

    - revisit travis and badge

## 3. Compilation

* Compilation steps

    | Source | Tool                                   | Result                   |
    |--------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|
    | source | (preprocess,compiler,assembler,linker) | executable               | 
    | source | (processor)                            | preprocessed source code | 
    |        | (compiler)                             | assembly                 | 
    |        | (assembler)                            | objectfile               | 
    |        | (linker)                               | executable               | 

* Create a simple C program

    ```C
    // $HOME/ece2400/sec1/example.c

    #include <stdio.h>

    void main()
    {
        int a = 1;
        int b = 2;
        int c = a + b;
        printf("%d + %d = %d\n", a, b, c);
    }
    ```

* Compile, assemble, link in one step

    ```bash
    cd $HOME/ece2400/sec1
    gcc -o example example.c
    ./example
    ```

* Compile, assemble, link in separate steps

    ```bash
    gcc -E -o example.i example.c
    less example.i
    gcc -S -o example.S example.i
    less example.S
    gcc -c -o example.o example.S
    objdump -dC example.o | less
    gcc -o example example.o
    objdump -dC example | less
    ./example
    ```

* Add file, commit, push

    - only add/commit source code, never generated code

        ```bash
        git add example.c
        git commit -m "added example c program"
        git push
        ```

    - `.gitignore` file
        - Contains a list of all files that must be ignored by git

            ```bash
            git status
            echo "*.i"      > .gitignore
            echo "*.S"     >> .gitignore
            echo "*.o"     >> .gitignore
            echo "example" >> .gitignore
            git add .gitignore
            git commit -m "Add .gitignore"
            git status
            ```

* Collaborate with your partner

    - have partner first pull, then edit/push example c program

        ```bash
        git pull
        gcc -o example example.c
        ./example
        cat example.c
        ```
